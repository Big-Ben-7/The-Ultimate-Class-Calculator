This is the ultimate calculator for all of your classes!

It can**:
* Peform real operations (eg. basic operations, trig functions including inverse trig and radian-degree conversion, combinatorics including combinations and permutations, power functions including any base logs, storing variables, etc.)
* Perform complex operations (eg. basic operations, power functions, conversion between rectangular and polar forms, etc.)
* Perform matrix operations (eg. basic operations, inverse, transformations, etc.)
* Perform summations with geometric series, arithmetic series, and binomial expansion (can also find specific terms, indexes, and other features)
* Find the root of cubic, quadratic, and linear equations and solve polynomial, rational, and absolute value inequalities.
* Give parameters (slope, vertices, directrix, foci, length of major and minor axes, asymptotes, etc.) of conic sections (line, parabola, circle, ellipse, and hyperbola)
* Graph functions
* Perform other function math (eg. derivative, function transformations, function symmetry, broken domain functions, etc.)

This calculator is especially suited for high school and above courses, such as Algebra 2 and Precalculus (the creator is currently taking Advanced Honors Precalculus as a 9th grader). For instructions, see the user manual page (can also be accessed inside the calculator).





** This calculator is currently in development. Some of the features listed above may not be fully functional yet. The developer is working hard to constantly update and improve the program.
