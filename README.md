This is the ultimate calculator for all of your classes!

It can:
* Peform real operations (eg. basic operations, trig functions including inverse trig and radian-degree conversion, combinatorics including combinations and permutations, power functions including any base logs, storing variables, etc.)
* Perform complex operations (eg. basic operations, power functions, conversion between rectangular and polar forms, etc.)
* Solve equations such as quadratic and linear equations
* Perform summations such as geometric series and binomial expansion (can also find specific terms and other characteristics)

This calculator is especially suited for algebra and precalculus courses (the creator is currently taking advanced honors precalculus as a 9th grader)
